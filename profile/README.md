# What is Islamipedia?
Islamipedia is a work in progress encyclopeadia on everything about or that is related to Islam. We want to be a knowledge center, a hub, for all the knowledge that is related to Islam. On top of that, we want to archive as much Islamic information such as books, videos, lectures, nasheeds and more for safe keeping. The end of times are already here.

## Planned features
I don't want to write a whole essay on all our features, so here are is all of them watered down:
* Basic to advanced: we want to provide a explanation for basic or fundamental understanding, but laso provide an advanced explanation for those who are in that level
* Wide range of opinions: we want to be able to cover a wide range of opinions from various schools of thoughts, sects, and scholars
* Connected ummah: we want to provide a platform where the ummah can communicate and talk with each other, in a civil and halal manner
* And finally, document / make available anything relating to Islam (including our third-party archives if we have permission or the project is inactive)
